# CodeMacabre

Hello! I'm Myles Lewando (pronounced [/ËŒlÊŒËˆvÃ¦ndÉ™ÊŠ/](https://itinerarium.github.io/phoneme-synthesis/?w=%2Fl%CA%8C%20v%C3%A6n%20d%C9%99%CA%8A%2F)), a web developer and designer with a touch of the macabre.

```
ðŸ–¤ Ethical & inclusive tech
ðŸ’œ Accessibility activist
ðŸ’™ People before code
ðŸ‘¤ He / they
```

My motto is "People before code".

I am an accessibility activist who fights for ethical and inclusive tech. I am an open-source and open-data advocate and you will often find me working on geospatial and data visualisation projects (usually ecological, humanitarian, or something macabre).

Please use he/they pronouns and always be kind.
