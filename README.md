# CodeMacabre

Hello! I'm Myles Lewando (pronounced [/ËŒlÊŒËˆvÃ¦ndÉ™ÊŠ/](https://itinerarium.github.io/phoneme-synthesis/?w=%2Fl%CA%8C%20v%C3%A6n%20d%C9%99%CA%8A%2F)), a web developer and designer with a touch of the macabre. I use he/they pronouns.

```
ðŸ–¤ Ethical & inclusive tech
ðŸ’œ Accessibility activist
ðŸ’™ People before code
ðŸ‘¤ He / they
```

I am an accessibility specialist-turned-activist who puts people before code. I value ethical open source and fight for fair and inclusive technology. Many of my personal projects are geospatial or data visualisation works, and tend to be ecological, humanitarian or related to mortality.
