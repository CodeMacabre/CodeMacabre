# CodeMacabre

Hello! I'm Myles Lewando (pronounced [/ˌlʌˈvændəʊ/](https://itinerarium.github.io/phoneme-synthesis/?w=%2Fl%CA%8C%20v%C3%A6n%20d%C9%99%CA%8A%2F)), a web developer and (aspiring) data artist based in the UK.

My work tends towards web and data visualisation (primarily geospatial) projects, often ecological, humanitarian, space-based, or the macabre. I am an ethical open-source and open-data advocate, and I highly value accessibility, inclusiveness, privacy and am a believer in self-directed learning.

Please use he/they pronouns and always be kind.
